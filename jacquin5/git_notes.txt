Things I learned about Git:
git init - initailizes a new repository
git add - adds the files to the staging area
git status - gives an overview of the files that haven't been pushed yet
git commit - commits files to the stage area which prepares to be pushed to the master branch
git remote <name of repository>
git push origin master - pushes files that where in the staged area to the master branch
